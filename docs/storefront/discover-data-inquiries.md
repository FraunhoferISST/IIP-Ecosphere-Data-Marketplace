If you can offer a data set matching the criteria of the data inquiry, you can contact the data inquirer by two means.
First, a data inquirer can be contacted by clicking on its name in the data inquiry to receive contact data to send a message outside of the data marketplace.
Second, a reply to the data inquiry can be send within the data marketplace.
To this end, fill out the message field below the data offer.
In case you want to include a data asset already listed on the data marketplace, check the box 'Include offers' and select the matching data offer.
To transmit the reply to the data inquirer, click on the 'Apply Offer' button.
