# Overview

The **IIP-Ecosphere Data Marketplace** lays the foundation for data sharing within enterprises, existing enterprise networks and beyond.

Simple structures, standardization and the open-source nature of the solution enable first steps in the data economy.

The self-determination of data creators is paramount, but at the same time  transparency for data consumers is provided.

## Why do we need a data marketplace?

In the industrial sector data typically remains in silos. This applies both enterprise-internal as well as between enterprises.
Hence, the value proposition of data analytics, artificial intelligence and simulation cannot be leveraged. Data remains unused and becomes so called "dark data".
As data becomes more diverse and bigger in its size, it starts to turn into a cost factor.

## How the data marketplace fosters data sharing

Regardless of whether the data is shared internally or externally, the same questions are always asked by potential users:

* Where can I get the data?
* What does the data look like?
* What quality can I expect?
* What policies exist for data usage?

On the side of data creators the compliant data usage according to enterprise or legal policies is a general concern.

With the IIP-Ecosphere Data Marketplace we created an open-source data marketplace solution that allows for the transparent and self-determined sharing of industrial and other data.
Data users looking for high quality and credible field data for product evaluation and improvement as well as process optimization or creation of new services get high transparency over available data products.

### Key features

#### üîå BYOM - Bring your own marketplace

The Data Marketplace can be up and running for your enterprise or your data ecosystem within minutes by using the provided Docker images.

#### ü§ù Marketplace Federation

While many entities can deploy their own Data Marketplace instance, global metadata visibility can be ensured by marketplace federation.
Metadata describing the data offerings initially remains in each own Data Marketplace instance and can be released for aggregation through a global instance to appeal to a wider audience.
E.g. data described for one enterprise or ecosystem in the first place can later be made available to further potential customers.

#### ‚≠ê Hybrid Architecture

The hybrid architecture combines the advantages of fully centralized and decentralized approaches.
Metadata for describing and locating the data offering is provided in the marketplace component.
After the purchase data is transferred between provider and consumer without relying on a marketplace instance.

#### üõ°Ô∏è Data Sovereignty

Data providers only provide metadata to the Data Catalog instance.
The actual data remains on their premises until the purchase is made.
Further, they can determine, who can see their data offerings.
By setting up their own data marketplace instance, even metadata can be protected.
Usage policies that should be kept after purchase can be defined.

#### ‚úâÔ∏è Fulfillment and Billing

Workflows for billing and automated invoice creation keep the overhead small and reduce potential externalities while exploring a new business model.

#### üìù Templates

Flexible templates for certain kinds of industrial data allow for the easier creation of data offerings for data producers as well as easier search, filter and comparability for data users.

## What is the relation to the wider IIP-Ecosphere ecosystem?

Within the IIP-Ecosphere project we want to shape a new kind of ecosystem for smart production that based on data and AI and connects industry, service providers, associations and research.
While new AI services and business models are being developed, they all rely on high quality and high volume data provided by enterprise-internal and external stakeholders.
Therefore data availability plays a big part in each endeavour.

The IIP-Ecosphere Data Marketplace aims to support these endeavours by facilitating access to data while considering the concerns of data producers, which in the industrial sector are often represented through small and medium enterprises.
